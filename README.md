# Data Science and Analytics Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my portfolio page!

My name is Jonny Herrick. 
I have been helping businesses to increase profit, earn market share and win customers since 2004. I have done this through education, data strategy, analytics, insights and making visualizations to tell stories and make the complex more digestible. 

Below are projects I've been working on.
